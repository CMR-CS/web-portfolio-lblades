           <p>In this unit we learned the basics of web page design. We began our learning with a history of the web, followed by beginnings in HTML. We also evaluated various websites, as to learn what to avoid as well as what to strive toward. From these foundational exercises, we moved onto topics that I never would've thought I would do. Exercises in text fundamentals, creating hyperlinks, and advanced text formatting where we revised a science correspondance application by marking up the letter. Overall, this first unit on HTML and structuring websites was worthwhile and informative, making something that I used to view as complex as something simple and do-able.
